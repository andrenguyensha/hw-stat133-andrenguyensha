This is Andre Sha's Workout #1. 

The purpose of this assignment is to gain experience with making a more complex file structure and using GitHub for the first time. Also, we are to visualize shot data from various GSW players, making things such as "shot charts". Afterwards, I will make a report, showing my adequacy as a aspiring statistician.
